# Change-Management
My Senior thesis was allowed to be about just about anything. My group decided that we wanted to research something practical, something that would help us in our future jobs. We chose the process of change management. In the beginning we didn't know where to start. Next thing we knew though, we couldn't figure what to cut out!

We explained some of the change managment process using github. The files labled Change-Management were created to help with that understanding.

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed working on it!
